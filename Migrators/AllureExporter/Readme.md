# Allure Exporter

You can use this exporter to export your test cases from Allure.

## Download

You can download the latest version of the AllureExporter from the [releases](https://github.com/testit-tms/migrators/releases/latest) page.

## How to use

1. Configure connection in the `allure.config.json` file and save it in the AllureExporter location.

```json
{
    "resultPath": "/Users/user01/Documents/importer",
    "allure": {
        "url": "https://allure.ru/",
        "token": "49a1238b-b0a6-4ebb-a47c-acb2b7a9c4e9",
        "projectName": "ProjectName"
    }
}
```

Where:

- resultPath - path to the folder where the results will be saved
- allure.url - url to the Allure server
- allure.token - token for access to the Allure server
- allure.projectName - name of the project in the Allure server

2. Run the exporter with the following command:

```bash
.\AllureExporter
```

3. Check the results in the folder specified in the `resultPath` parameter.

4. Use the results in the [importer](https://github.com/testit-tms/migrators/tree/main/Migrators/Importer/Readme.md).
