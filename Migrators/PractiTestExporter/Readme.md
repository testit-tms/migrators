# PractiTest Exporter

You can use this exporter to export your test cases from PractiTest.

## Download

You can download the latest version of the PractiTestExporter from the [releases](https://github.com/testit-tms/migrators/releases/latest) page.

## How to use

1. Configure connection in the `practitest.config.json` file and save it in the PractiTestExporter location.

```json
{
  "resultPath": "/Users/user01/Documents/importer",
  "practiTest": {
    "url": "https://prod-api.practitest.app",
    "token": "a7b9bea53f1e7a6ef7d3052969b55926680bc13b",
    "projectId": "15467"
  }
}
```

Where:

- resultPath - path to the folder where the results will be saved
- practiTest.url - PractiTest API url
- practiTest.token - token for access to the PractiTest
- practiTest.projectName - name of the project in the PractiTest

2. Run the exporter with the following command:

```bash
.\PractiTestExporter
```

3. Check the results in the folder specified in the `resultPath` parameter.

4. Use the results in the [importer](https://github.com/testit-tms/migrators/tree/main/Migrators/Importer/Readme.md).
