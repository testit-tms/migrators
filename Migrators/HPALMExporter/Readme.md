# HP ALM Exporter

You can use this exporter to export your test cases from HP ALM.

## Download

You can download the latest version of the HPALMExporter from the [releases](https://github.com/testit-tms/migrators/releases/latest) page.

## How to use

1. Configure connection in the `hpalm.config.json` file and save it in the HPALMExporter location.

```json
{
  "resultPath": "/Users/user01/Documents/importer/hpalm",
  "hpalm": {
    "url": "http://alm.server.ru:8080",
    "clientId": "apikey-egaoktntfhidsjoddmcp",
    "secret": "dpojbgifjifbjplf",
    "domainName": "DEFAULT",
    "projectName": "Migration"
  }
}
```

Where:

- resultPath - path to the folder where the results will be saved
- hpalm.url - url to the SpiraTest server with organization name
- hpalm.clientId - clientId for access to the HP ALM server
- hpalm.secret - secret for access to the HP ALM server
- hpalm.domainName - name of the domain in the HP ALM server
- hpalm.projectName - name of the project in the HP ALM server

1. Run the exporter with the following command:

```bash
.\HPALMExporter
```

3. Check the results in the folder specified in the `resultPath` parameter.

4. Use the results in the [importer](https://github.com/testit-tms/migrators/tree/main/Migrators/Importer/Readme.md).
